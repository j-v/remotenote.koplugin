# RemoteNote Plugin for KOReader

Adding annotations to your ebooks is a very useful, but typing on the on-screen keyboard of an e-ink display is cumbersome and slow. RemoteNote lets you use another device to type in notes to the passages you highlight in KOReader.

### Supported devices
Tested working on an old Kindle Paperwhite. Your experience may vary.

**Note:** be aware that opening RemoteNote starts a simple web server with an unsecured connection on your e-reader. It may be wise to avoid use on public networks.
