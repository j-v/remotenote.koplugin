# RemoteNote Plugin for KOReader

Adding annotations to your ebooks is a very useful, but typing on the on-screen keyboard of an e-ink display is cumbersome and slow. RemoteNote lets you use another device to type in notes to the passages you highlight in KOReader.

> **Note:** be aware that by default, opening RemoteNote starts a simple web server with an unsecured connection on your e-reader. It may be wise to avoid use on public networks.
> You can enable HTTPS in the RemoteNote menu, for which you must generate a self-signed certificate and copy to the plugin folder. This will ensure content is transmitted encrypted, but is still subject to the limitations of self-signed certificates such as man-in-the-middle attacks.

### Supported devices
